This project was developed as the culminating project for a full-stack bootcamp, representing the combined efforts of three collaborators, Daniele, Yago and Hamed. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program.

This application fosters a collaborative environment for people to give away unwanted items in a convenient and eco-friendly way.
Users can add the location of "giving boxes" placed on streets and descriptions of the items inside.
Others can then search for these boxes using a map interface and collect useful items, promoting reuse and reducing waste.

User-friendly platform:
Allows users to register and log in for secure access.
Provides a profile management section for updating user information.
Implements a password change functionality for enhanced security.

Item sharing and discovery:
Enables users to add items with descriptions and potential images.
Offers a space for users to leave comments and interact with items.
Location awareness:
Integrates a Google Map feature to potentially display item locations

Data persistence:
